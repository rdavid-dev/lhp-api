# lhp
This project will serve as the API of the LHP UI, in order to run this application please follow the guide below.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Docker application installed on your machine.

### Steps
- 1. Clone the Project anywhere on your machine
- 2. Go to the directory by running `cd lhp`
- 3. I assumed you have the Docker installed now, so run docker-compose up -d --build to install all dependencies(php, nginx, mysql, phpmyadmin)
- 4. When all dependencies are running, let's install the Laravel Application by running the command `cd src`, since you already on the root folder.
